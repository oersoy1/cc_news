(CBS Local) — A Washington state man was stabbed in the neck and robbed by a group of teenagers, including his granddaughter, on Monday night, police said. The victim, 66, told investigators he was inside his home in Hazel Dell, Washington, when his granddaughter and three other teens entered the house, assaulted him and left with his car, wallet and cellphone. He was treated at a nearby hospital for life-threatening injuries. Officers tracked down the stolen vehicle in Seaside, Oregon, and pursued it. The car crashed into a swamp area and three of the suspects were arrested. The fourth suspect ran off and approached the home of Adam Israel, who said he was aware of police activity in the area. @ClarkCoSheriff responded to robbery yesterday near 83rd/26th. Deputies found a 66 y/o man stabbed in the neck. The victim told deputies his granddaughter and 3 other teens assaulted him and stole his wallet, phone and car. They were arrested in Clatsop Co. @KOINNews pic.twitter.com/zwNh7NKBDO — Jacquelyn Abad (@JacquelynAbadTV) December 17, 2019 “He walks up on my front porch and starts banging on my door and ringing the doorbell” Israel told CBS affiliate KOIN. “I grabbed my firearm and tell my family to get upstairs.” After walking around the porch and kicking the door, the suspect left. Israel watched him go to a nearby house to ask for dry clothing. The woman who answered the door turned him away. “He needed medical assistance because it was really cold last night — it was probably in the low 30s,” he said. Officers arrested the fourth suspect about 90 minutes later. One of the suspects, aged between 14 and 17 years old, was treated for minor injuries before being released back to authorities. Two of the suspects, both 17-year-old boys, are facing first-degree robbery and second-degree attempted murder charges, KATU reported.

The Commence solution is designed to meet the following objectives: • Streamline internal business processes • Execution of a structured approach for optimizing the sales process • Delight your customers with world-class customer service According to Larry Caretsky, President of Commence Corporation (www.commence.com/mfg/), “Contrary to popular belief all CRM solutions are not alike. Manufacturers and distributors are beginning to realize that they don’t’ need overly complex or costly solutions to efficiently manage customer relationships. These organizations are beginning to turn their attention to more affordable, easier to use solutions that address their industry specific business requirements.” The CRM industry has been plagued by vendors offering overly complex solutions to solve basic business problems. This has resulted in a low adoption rate and failed customer expectations. The concern for most businesses today is not a lack of technology, but rather how they can leverage technology to improve their internal processes and ultimately their bottom line. Commence has taken a unique approach to meeting these objectives beginning with the fundamental knowledge that most small to mid-size manufacturers and distributors must first address the problem of data capture, data consolidation and data sharing. The issue they face is that vital customer information is spread throughout their organization in contact managers, back office systems and excel spreadsheets and is often difficult to attain. Employees spend a significant amount of time trying to determine where or who in the organization has the information they need to address customer inquiries. This robs sales and service people of precious time during their day. Caretsky assures that “Industrial management recognizes this problem and realizes that in order to become a more efficient sales and service organization they must get the right information in the hands of the right people at the right time.” Commence offers lean industrial companies complete “Freedom Of Choice” to select the solutions and platform that best meets the business requirements of manufacturers and distributors. The comprehensive CRM Industrial application suite is available for use on premise or on-demand as a hosted service. Industrial leaders often build departmental lean CRM solutions with the award winning Commence Lean Industrial CRM Framework. These choices are why so many industrial companies choose Commence as the solution for managing customer relationships. All Commence Industrial solutions support mobile or wireless connectivity and integration to back-office accounting and ERP systems.

(CBS Local) — A Washington state man was stabbed in the neck and robbed by a group of teenagers, including his granddaughter, on Monday night, police said. The victim, 66, told investigators he was inside his home in Hazel Dell, Washington, when his granddaughter and three other teens entered the house, assaulted him and left with his car, wallet and cellphone. He was treated at a nearby hospital for life-threatening injuries. Officers tracked down the stolen vehicle in Seaside, Oregon, and pursued it. The car crashed into a swamp area and three of the suspects were arrested. The fourth suspect ran off and approached the home of Adam Israel, who said he was aware of police activity in the area. @ClarkCoSheriff responded to robbery yesterday near 83rd/26th. Deputies found a 66 y/o man stabbed in the neck. The victim told deputies his granddaughter and 3 other teens assaulted him and stole his wallet, phone and car. They were arrested in Clatsop Co. @KOINNews pic.twitter.com/zwNh7NKBDO — Jacquelyn Abad (@JacquelynAbadTV) December 17, 2019 “He walks up on my front porch and starts banging on my door and ringing the doorbell” Israel told CBS affiliate KOIN. “I grabbed my firearm and tell my family to get upstairs.” After walking around the porch and kicking the door, the suspect left. Israel watched him go to a nearby house to ask for dry clothing. The woman who answered the door turned him away. “He needed medical assistance because it was really cold last night — it was probably in the low 30s,” he said. Officers arrested the fourth suspect about 90 minutes later. One of the suspects, aged between 14 and 17 years old, was treated for minor injuries before being released back to authorities. Two of the suspects, both 17-year-old boys, are facing first-degree robbery and second-degree attempted murder charges, KATU reported.

PHOTO: South China Morning Post Victor Ting South China Morning Post Dec 18, 2019 With the push of a button on mobile phones especially designed for the elderly, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong's senior citizens have found emergency help for their medical needs, counselling support, and other care services for almost a decade. Earlier this month, Senior Citizen Home Safety Association launched the third generation of its \"safety phone\" device, which has been popular among the elderly for nine years. Using \"location-based\" technology, the NGO will be able to monitor and call its elderly service recipients, and their family members or carers if necessary, if they have not used their phones for more than a day. \"In an ageing society where a third of our citizens will soon be above the age of 65, we need to reimagine the care we offer them,\" Maura Wong, CEO of the association, said. \"This new feature will allow us to check on the elderly, to see if anything has gone wrong and why haven't they left their homes or used their phones to call someone for a few days.\" Last year, 80,000 elderly users made 700,000 calls, or 2,000 calls a day on average, to the NGO. About 100 calls were received every day with requests for an ambulance. The phone, costing HK$188 (S$33) per month, has a traditional flip-open design with numbers on a keyboard rather than a touch screen, and extra large words on the screen. NGO chairwoman Christine Fang Meng-sang said her organisation had evolved with the times and expanded to include a round-the-clock hotline service, with a team of nurses, counsellors and social workers providing help over the phone, ranging from making appointments at pub\n"
